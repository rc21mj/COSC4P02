We will save user and post information like this and when we want to display each users post we grab the currently signed in user, iterate through all posts, and grab each post by postinstanceID, we take this id and reference it against the posts table where we grab each Concrete post URL and display the information to the user.
When generating a post we update the posts table with the postinstance and update it in userPosts as well under users. Then when we are actually posting online we just update the posts table with a concretePost for each actual posting.
